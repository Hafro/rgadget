Rgadget is a set of useful utilities for gadget, a statistical
multi-species multi-area marine ecosystem modelling toolbox.

This package aids in the developement of Gadget models in a number of
ways. It can interact with Gadget, by manipulating input files, digest
output and rudimentary plots.

	fit <- gadget.fit()
	plot(fit)
